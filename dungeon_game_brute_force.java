/*ðŸ”¹ Example:

Suppose min(right, down) = 5 and dungeon[i][j] = -3 (this cell costs 3 health):

result = 5 - (-3)
       = 5 + 3
       = 8


So you need 8 health at this cell to survive the path.

If dungeon[i][j] = 3 (cell gives 3 health):

result = 5 - 3
       = 2


You only need 2 health at this cell to survive the path.
